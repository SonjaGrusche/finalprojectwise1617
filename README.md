# Final Project WiSe 16/17
A repository containing the code of the "watch out[side] machine" website for my final semester project. It's based on the seminar "Automation, Representation, Transmission" conducted by Jonathan Reus. Feel free to download my code if you like!
All programs are written by Sonja Grusche
